# Indexes
```
- Indexes are used by queries to find data from tables quickly using B-Tree. Indexes are created on tables and views. 
- SELECT Faster 
- WHERE , JOIN, ORDER BY, GROUP more efficient
- But INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE will slow
```
To check index in one table using:
`sp_Helpindex [table name]`

To drop table:
`drop index [index name]`
